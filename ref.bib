	abstract = {The results of optical investigation of hydrogenated epitaxial bilayer graphene are presented. A softening and an increase of the intensity of the in-plane anti-symmetric phonon mode are observed at 0.2 eV. It is suggested that they both originate from coupling of the optically active phonon mode to virtual electronic transitions, which is related to the band structure of bilayer graphene and leads to the “charged phonon” effect. In addition, it is noted that optically active phonon peaks have pronounced Fano shapelines. It is argued that the Fano shapeline is attributed to the interaction of the phonon mode with a continuum of electronic transitions in valence bands of hydrogenated bilayer graphene.},

              The ordinary Fano effect occurs in many-electron atoms and requires an autoionizing state. With such a state, photo-ionization may proceed via pathways that interfere, and the characteristic asymmetric resonance structures appear in the continuum. Here we demonstrate that Fano structure may also be induced without need of auto-ionization, by dressing the continuum with an ordinary bound state in any atom by a coupling laser. Using multi-photon processes gives complete, ultra-fast control over the interference. We show that a line-shape index
              q
              near unity (maximum asymmetry) may be produced in hydrogenic silicon donors with a relatively weak beam. Since the Fano lineshape has both constructive and destructive interference, the laser control opens the possibility of state-selective detection with enhancement on one side of resonance and invisibility on the other. We discuss a variety of atomic and molecular spectroscopies, and in the case of silicon donors we provide a calculation for a qubit readout application.},

An alternative manner to extract the coupling is to use the one- and two-phonon loss ratio, which is governed by the e-p coupling strength and the core-hole lifetime. This allows the determination of the e-p coupling on an absolute energy scale.},

              We present a method for computing the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra in one-dimensional systems using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. By using DMRG to address this problem, we shift the computational bottleneck from the memory requirements associated with exact diagonalization (ED) calculations to the computational time associated with the DMRG algorithm. This approach is then used to obtain RIXS spectra on cluster sizes well beyond state-of-the-art ED techniques. Using this new procedure, we compute the low-energy magnetic excitations observed in Cu

	abstract = {Inelastic low-energy Raman and high-energy X-ray scatterings have made great progress in instrumentation to investigate the strong electronic correlations in matter. However, theoretical study of the relevant scattering spectrum is still a challenge. In this paper, we present a Schwinger–Keldysh canonical perturbation formalism for the electronic Raman scattering, where all the resonant, non-resonant and mixed responses are considered uniformly. We show how to use this formalism to evaluate the cross section of the electronic Raman scattering off an one-band superconductor. All the two-photon scattering processes from electrons, the non-resonant charge density response, the elastic Rayleigh scattering, the ﬂuorescence, the intrinsic energy-shift Raman scattering and the mixed response, are included. In the mean-ﬁeld superconducting state, Cooper pairs contribute only to the non-resonant response. All the other responses are dominated by the single-particle excitations and are strongly suppressed due to the opening of the superconducting gap. Our formalism for the electronic Raman scattering can be easily extended to study the high-energy resonant inelastic X-ray scattering.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of strongly surface-plane-dependent superconductivity at surfaces of KTaO\$\_3\$ single crystals, we calculate the electron-phonon coupling strength, \${\textbackslash}lambda\$, of doped KTaO\$\_3\$ along the reciprocal-space high-symmetry directions. Using the Wannier-function approach implemented in the EPW package, we calculate \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ across the experimentally covered doping range and compare its mode-resolved distribution along the [001], [110] and [111] reciprocal-space directions. We find that the electron-phonon coupling is strongest in the optical modes around the \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ point, with some distribution to higher \$k\$ values in the [001] direction. The electron-phonon coupling strength as a function of doping has a dome-like shape in all three directions and its integrated total is largest in the [001] direction and smallest in the [111] direction, in contrast to the experimentally measured trends in critical temperatures. This disagreement points to a non-BCS character of the superconductivity. Instead, the strong localization of \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ in the soft optical modes around \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ suggests an importance of ferroelectric soft-mode fluctuations, which is supported by our findings that the mode-resolved \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ values are strongly enhanced in polar structures. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling has negligible influence on our calculated mode-resolved \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ values.},

	abstract = {A conduction electron (or hole) together with its self-induced polarisation in a polar semiconductor or an ionic crystal forms a quasi-particle, which is called a polaron. The polaron concept is of interest, not only because it describes the particular physical properties of charge carriers in polarizable solids but also because it constitutes an interesting field theoretical model of a fermion interacting with a scalar boson field. The early work on polarons was concerned with general theoretical formulations and approximations, which now constitute the standard polaron theory, and with experiments on cyclotron resonance and transport properties. Because of the more recent interest in the two-dimensional electron gas, the study of the polaron in two dimensions became important. Again cyclotron resonance, and therefore the behaviour of polarons in magnetic fields, was a key issue. When two electrons (or two holes) interact with each other simultaneously through the Coulomb force and via the electron-phonon-electron interaction, either two independent polarons can occur or a bound state of two polarons - a bipolaron - can arise. Bipolarons have been considered to possibly play a role in high-Tc superconductivity. The polaron concept has been extended to several systems where one or many fermions interact with a bath of bosons, e. g., small polaron, piezopolaron, polaronic exciton, spin - or magnetic - polaron, "ripplonic polaron", "plasmaron", "hydrated polarons" etc.},

At differently-oriented interfaces, the quasi-three-dimensional electron gas ubiquitously exists and spatially overlaps with the small q Fuchs-Kliewer surface phonons. Intriguingly, electrons and the Fuchs-Kliewer phonons couple with different strengths depending on the interfacial orientations, and the stronger coupling correlates with the higher superconducting transition temperature. Our results provide a natural explanation for the orientation-dependent superconductivity, and the first evidence that interfacial orientations can affect electron-phonon coupling strength over several nanometers, which may have profound implications for the applications of oxide interfaces in general.},

              Static stripe order is detrimental to superconductivity. Yet, it has been proposed that transverse stripe fluctuations may enhance the inter-stripe Josephson coupling and thus promote superconductivity. Direct experimental studies of stripe dynamics, however, remain difficult. From a strong-coupling perspective, transverse stripe fluctuations are realized in the form of dynamic “kinks”—sideways shifting stripe sections. Here, we show how modest uniaxial pressure tuning reorganizes directional kink alignment. Our starting point is La

Application of mild uniaxial pressure changes the ordering pattern and pins the stripe order to the crystal axis. This reordering occurs at a much weaker pressure than that to detwin the stripe domains and suggests a rather weak transverse stripe stiffness. Weak spatial stiffness and transverse quantum fluctuations are likely key prerequisites for stripes to coexist with superconductivity.},

              In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, stripe order refers broadly to a coupled spin and charge modulation with a commensuration of eight and four lattice units, respectively. How this stripe order evolves across optimal doping remains a controversial question. Here we present a systematic resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of weak charge correlations in La

Long-range temperature-dependent stripe order is only found below optimal doping. At higher doping, short-range temperature-independent correlations are present up to the highest doping measured. This transformation is distinct from and preempts the pseudogap critical doping. We argue that the doping and temperature-independent short-range correlations originate from unresolved electron–phonon coupling that broadly peaks at the stripe ordering vector.

              The Hubbard model (HM) describes the behavior of interacting particles on a lattice where the particles can hop from one lattice site to the next. Although it appears simple, solving the HM when the interactions are repulsive, the particles are fermions, and the temperature is low—all of which applies in the case of correlated electron systems—is computationally challenging. Two groups have tackled this important problem. Huang

              et al.
              used five complementary numerical methods that kept each other in check to discern the ground state of the HM. Both groups found evidence for stripes, or one-dimensional charge and/or spin density modulations.

            Upon doping, Mott insulators often exhibit symmetry breaking where charge carriers and their spins organize into patterns known as stripes. For high–transition temperature cuprate superconductors, stripes are widely suspected to exist in a fluctuating form. We used numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations to demonstrate dynamical stripe correlations in the three-band Hubbard model, which represents the local electronic structure of the copper-oxygen plane. Our results, which are robust to varying parameters, cluster size, and boundary conditions, support the interpretation of experimental observations such as the hourglass magnetic dispersion and the Yamada plot of incommensurability versus doping in terms of the physics of fluctuating stripes. These findings provide a different perspective on the intertwined orders emerging from the cuprates’ normal state.},

              Although all superconducting cuprates display charge-ordering tendencies, their low-temperature properties are distinct, impeding efforts to understand the phenomena within a single conceptual framework.

We find that high-temperature charge correlations are unlocked from the wavevector of the spin correlations, signaling analogies to CDW phases in various other cuprates. This indicates that stripe order at low temperatures is stabilized by the coupling of otherwise independent charge and spin density waves, with important implications for the relation between charge and spin correlations in the cuprates.},

              Charge-density waves (CDWs) are a ubiquitous form of electron density modulation in cuprate superconductors.

	abstract = {The presence of different electronic orders other than superconductivity populating the phase diagram of cuprates suggests that they might be the key to disclose the mysteries of this class of materials. In particular charge order in the form of charge density waves (CDW), i.e., the incommensurate modulation of electron density in the CuO\$\_2\$ planes, is ubiquitous across different families and presents a clear interplay with superconductivity. Until recently, CDW had been found to be confined inside a rather small region of the phase diagram, below the pseudogap temperature and the optimal doping. This occurrence might shed doubts on the possibility that such "low temperature phenomenon" actually rules the properties of cuprates either in the normal or in the superconducting states. However, recent resonant X-ray scattering (RXS) experiments are overturning this paradigm. It results that very short-ranged charge modulations permeate a much wider region of the phase diagram, coexisting with CDW at lower temperatures and persisting up to temperatures well above the pseudogap opening. Here we review the characteristics of these high temperature charge modulations, which are present in several cuprate families, with similarities and differences. A particular emphasis is put on their dynamical character and on their coupling to lattice and magnetic excitations, properties that can be determined with high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS).},

We report high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments that reveal the presence of dynamic electron correlations over the qx-qy scattering plane in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ with Tc = 54 K. We use the softening of the RIXS-measured bond stretching phonon line as a marker for the presence of charge-order-related dynamic electron correlations. The experiments show that these dynamic correlations exist at energies below approximately 70 meV and are centered around a quasi-circular manifold in the qx-qy scattering plane with radius equal to the magnitude of the charge order wave vector, qCO. We also demonstrate how this phonon-tracking procedure provides the necessary experimental precision to rule out ﬂuctuations of short-range directional charge order (i.e. centered around [qx = ±qCO, qy = 0] and [qx = 0, qy = ±qCO]) as the origin of the observed correlations.},

In addition to these self-energy effects, the electron-phonon coupling is probed by its proportionality to the RIXS cross section. We find an enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling around the charge-stripe ordering wave vector upon cooling into the low-temperature tetragonal structure phase. These results suggest that, in addition to electronic correlations, electron-phonon coupling contributes substantially to the emergence of long-range charge-stripe order in cuprates.},

Gapped quantum matter is illustrated by a simple discussion of the Z\_2 spin liquid, and connections are made to topological field theories. I discuss how conformal matter is realized at quantum critical points of realistic lattice models, and make connections to a number of experimental systems. Recent progress in our understanding of compressible quantum phases which are not Fermi liquids is summarized. Finally, I discuss how the strongly-coupled phases of quantum matter may be described by gauge-gravity duality. The structure of the large N limit of SU(N) gauge theory, coupled to adjoint fermion matter at non-zero density, suggests aspects of gravitational duals of compressible quantum matter.},

              cuprate superconductors. While the presence of a dispersive signal in the high-energy charge-excitation spectrum is well accepted in the electron-doped cuprates, its interpretation and universality are controversial. Since charge fluctuations are observed ubiquitously in cuprate superconductors, the understanding of its origin is a pivotal issue. Here, we employ the layered

The high-energy charge excitations, therefore, should be a universal feature in cuprate superconductors and are expected also in the hole-doped cuprates. Acoustic-like plasmons in cuprates have not been recognized yet in experiments. We propose several experimental tests to distinguish different interpretations of the high-energy charge excitations.},

Such frustration can be introduced through either the geometry of lattice structures or by incompatible exchange interactions. Identifying suitable strategies to control the degree of magnetic frustration in real systems is an active field of research. In this study, we devise a design principle for the tuning of frustrated magnetism on the square lattice through the manipulation of nearest (NN) and next-nearest neighbor (NNN) antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange interactions. By studying the magnon excitations in epitaxially-strained La\$\_2\$NiO\$\_4\$ films using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) we show that, in contrast to the cuprates, the dispersion peaks at the AF zone boundary. This indicates the presence of an AF-NNN spin interaction. Using first principles simulations and an effective spin-model, we demonstrate the AF-NNN coupling to be a consequence of the two-orbital nature of La\$\_2\$NiO\$\_4\$. Our results demonstrate that compressive strain can enhance this coupling, providing a design principle for the tunability of frustrated magnetism on a square lattice.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous symmetry breaking constitutes a paradigmatic classification scheme of matter. However, broken symmetry also entails domain degeneracy that often impedes identification of novel low symmetry states. In quantum matter, this is additionally complicated by competing intertwined symmetry breaking orders. A prime example is that of unconventional superconductivity and density-wave orders in doped cuprates in which their respective symmetry relation remains a key question. Using uniaxial pressure as a domain-selective stimulus in combination with x-ray diffraction, we unambiguously reveal that the fundamental symmetry of the charge order in the prototypical cuprate La\$\_\{1.88\}\$Sr\$\_\{0.12\}\$CuO\$\_4\$ is characterized by uniaxial stripes. We further demonstrate the direct competition of this stripe order with unconventional superconductivity via magnetic field tuning. The stripy nature of the charge-density-wave state established by our study is a prerequisite for the existence of a superconducting pair-density-wave -- a theoretical proposal that clarifies the interrelation of intertwined quantum phases in unconventional superconductors -- and paves the way for its high-temperature realization.},

	abstract = {The I21 beamline at Diamond Light Source is dedicated to advanced resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) for probing charge, orbital, spin and lattice excitations in materials across condensed matter physics, applied sciences and chemistry. Both the beamline and the RIXS spectrometer employ divergent variable-line-spacing gratings covering a broad energy range of 280–3000 eV. A combined energy resolution of ∼35 meV (16 meV) is readily achieved at 930 eV (530 eV) owing to the optimized optics and the mechanics. Considerable efforts have been paid to the design of the entire beamline, particularly the implementation of the collection mirrors, to maximize the X-ray photon throughput. The continuous rotation of the spectrometer over 150° under ultra high vacuum and a cryogenic manipulator with six degrees of freedom allow accurate mappings of low-energy excitations from solid state materials in momentum space. Most importantly, the facility features a unique combination of the high energy resolution and the high photon throughput vital for advanced RIXS applications. Together with its stability and user friendliness, I21 has become one of the most sought after RIXS beamlines in the world.},

The material exhibits the Ohmic metal characteristic of Pb(6s1) above its superconducting critical temperature, Tc, and the levitation phenomenon as Meissner effect of a superconductor at room temperature and atmospheric pressure below Tc. A LK-99® sample shows Tc above 126.85℃ (400K). We analyze that the possibility of room-temperature superconductivity in this material is attributed to two factors: the first being the volume contraction resulting from an insulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and the second being on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by the structural deformation in the one-dimensional(D) chain (Pb2−O1/2−Pb2 along the c-axis) structure owing to superconducting condensation at Tc. The mechanism of the room-temperature Tc is discussed by 1-D BR-BCS theory.},

	abstract = {For the first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the room-temperature superconductor (Tc ≥ 400 K, 127 oC) working at ambient pressure with a modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. The superconductivity of LK-99 is proved with the Critical temperature (Tc), Zero-resistivity, Critical current (Ic), Critical magnetic field (Hc), and the Meissner effect. The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from minute structural distortion by a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 \%), not by external factors such as temperature and pressure. The shrinkage is caused by Cu2+ substitution of Pb2+(2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate and it generates the stress. It concurrently transfers to Pb(1) of the cylindrical column resulting in distortion of the cylindrical column interface, which creates superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The heat capacity results indicated that the new model is suitable for explaining the superconductivity of LK-99. The unique structure of LK-99 that allows the minute distorted structure to be maintained in the interfaces is the most important factor that LK-99 maintains and exhibits superconductivity at room temperatures and ambient pressure.},

	abstract = {In conclusion, we propose a two-orbital tJ model to describe the essential physics of LK-99, the candidate material with possible room temperature superconductivity. Our theoretical calculation predicts a s wave pairing. Given that t-J model usually predicts a higher angular momentum pairing, the model is certainly conceptual interesting and worth future theoretical and numerical studies. It is also interesting to explore the possibility that phonon cooperates with the superexchange J to further enhance the pairing strength. The relevance of the model to LK-99 remains to be investigated in future experimental studies. To obtain a superconductor with Tc ∼ 100K, we need the value of t to be at least one magnitude larger than the predicted values from DFT calculations. The exact mechanism to generate such a large hopping is not clear now, but may be related to the distortion caused by the Cu atoms. We conjecture that there may be local region which is compressed and thus has a large hopping and a strong s wave pairing according to our model. This picture suggest that LK-99 may be in the category of granular superconductor. If true, there is likely strong sample dependence with possible superconductor, insulator and even anomalous metal depending on sample details. We also propose to realize our model and the possible high Tc s-wave superconductor in other materials with active dxz and dyz orbitals.},

	abstract = {X-ray techniques have been used for more than a century to study the atomic and electronic structure in practically any type of material. The advent of correlated electron systems, in particular complex oxides, brought about new scientiﬁc challenges and opportunities for the advancement of conventional X-ray methods. In this context, the need for new approaches capable of selectively sensing new forms of orders involving all degrees of freedom—charge, orbital, spin, and lattice—paved the way for the emergence and success of resonant X-ray scattering, which has become an increasingly popular and powerful tool for the study of electronic ordering phenomena in solids. We review the recent resonant X-ray scattering breakthroughs in the copper oxide high-temperature superconductors, in particular regarding the phenomenon of charge order, a broken-symmetry state occurring when valence electrons self-organize into periodic structures. After a brief historical perspective on charge order, we outline the milestones in the development of resonant X-ray scattering as well as the basic theoretical formalism underlying its unique capabilities. The rest of the review focuses on the recent contributions of resonant scattering to the advancements in our description and understanding of charge order. To conclude, we propose a series of present and upcoming challenges and discuss the future outlook for this technique.},

	abstract = {One of the major themes in correlated electron physics over the last quarter century has been the problem of high-temperature superconductivity in hole-doped copper-oxide compounds. Fundamental to this problem is the competition between antiferromagnetic spin correlations, a symptom of strong Coulomb interactions, and the kinetic energy of the doped carriers, which favors delocalization. After discussing some of the early challenges in the ﬁeld, I describe the experimental picture provided by a variety of spectroscopic and transport techniques. Then I turn to the technique of neutron scattering, and discuss how it is used to determine spin correlations, especially in model systems of quantum magnetism. Neutron scattering and complementary techniques have determined the extent to which antiferromagnetic spin correlations survive in the cuprate superconductors. One experimental case involves the ordering of spin and charge stripes. I ﬁrst consider related measurements on model compounds, such as La2−xSrxNiO4+δ , and then discuss the case of La2−xBaxCuO4. In the latter system, recent transport studies have demonstrated that quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity coexists with the stripe order, but with frustrated phase order between the layers. This has led to new concepts for the coexistence of spin order and superconductivity. While the relevance of stripe correlations to high-temperature superconductivity remains a subject of controversy, there is no question that stripes are an intriguing example of electron matter that results from strong correlations.},

              More than 30 years after the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides, its mechanism remains a mystery. Electron pairing mediated solely by lattice vibrations—phonons—is thought to be insufficient to account for the high transition temperatures. He
              et al.
              found a rapid and correlated increase of the superconducting gap and electron-phonon interactions as the chemical composition of their bismuth-based cuprate samples was varied across a critical doping concentration. The interplay of electron-phonon with electron-electron interactions may lead to enhanced transition temperatures.

In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the superconducting gap and the bosonic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi

	abstract = {Measured transport properties of three representative cuprates are reproduced within the paradigm of two electron subsystems, itinerant and localized. The localized subsystem evolves continuously from the Cu 3d9 hole at half-filling and corresponds to the (pseudo)gapped parts of the Fermi surface. The itinerant subsystem is observed as a pure Fermi liquid (FL) with material-independent universal mobility across the doping/temperature phase diagram. The localized subsystem affects the itinerant one in our transport calculations solely by truncating the textbook FL integrals to the observed (doping- and temperature-dependent) Fermi arcs. With this extremely simple picture, we obtain the measured evolution of the resistivity and Hall coefficients in all three cases considered, including LSCO which undergoes a Lifshitz transition in the relevant doping range, a complication which turns out to be superficial. Our results imply that prior to evoking polaronic, quantum critical point, quantum dissipation, or even more exotic scenarios for the evolution of transport properties in cuprates, Fermi-surface properties must be addressed in realistic detail.},

              BACKGROUND
              Landau’s Fermi liquid theory provides the bedrock on which our understanding of metals has developed over the past 65 years. Its basic premise is that the electrons transporting a current can be treated as “quasiparticles”—electron-like particles whose effective mass has been modified, typically through interactions with the atomic lattice and/or other electrons. For a long time, it seemed as though Landau’s theory could account for all the many-body interactions that exist inside a metal, even in the so-called heavy fermion systems whose quasiparticle mass can be up to three orders of magnitude heavier than the electron’s mass. Fermi liquid theory also lay the foundation for the first successful microscopic theory of superconductivity.
              In the past few decades, a number of new metallic systems have been discovered that violate this paradigm. The violation is most evident in the way that the electrical resistivity changes with temperature or magnetic field. In normal metals in which electrons are the charge carriers, the resistivity increases with increasing temperature but saturates, both at low temperatures (because the quantized lattice vibrations are frozen out) and at high temperatures (because the electron mean free path dips below the smallest scattering pathway defined by the lattice spacing). In “strange metals,” by contrast, no saturation occurs, implying that the quasiparticle description breaks down and electrons are no longer the primary charge carriers. When the particle picture breaks down, no local entity carries the current.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              A new classification of metallicity is not a purely academic exercise, however, as strange metals tend to be the high-temperature phase of some of the best superconductors available. Understanding high-temperature superconductivity stands as a grand challenge because its resolution is fundamentally rooted in the physics of strong interactions, a regime where electrons no longer move independently. Precisely what new emergent phenomena one obtains from the interactions that drive the electron dynamics above the temperature where they superconduct is one of the most urgent problems in physics, attracting the attention of condensed matter physicists as well as string theorists. One thing is clear in this regime: The particle picture breaks down. As particles and locality are typically related, the strange metal raises the distinct possibility that its resolution must abandon the basic building blocks of quantum theory.
              We review the experimental and theoretical studies that have shaped our current understanding of the emergent strongly interacting physics realized in a host of strange metals, with a special focus on their poster-child: the copper oxide high-temperature superconductors. Experiments are highlighted that attempt to link the phenomenon of nonsaturating resistivity to parameter-free universal physics. A key experimental observation in such materials is that removing a single electron affects the spectrum at all energy scales, not just the low-energy sector as in a Fermi liquid. It is observations of this sort that reinforce the breakdown of the single-particle concept. On the theoretical side, the modern accounts that borrow from the conjecture that strongly interacting physics is really about gravity are discussed extensively, as they have been the most successful thus far in describing the range of physics displayed by strange metals. The foray into gravity models is not just a pipe dream because in such constructions, no particle interpretation is given to the charge density. As the breakdown of the independent-particle picture is central to the strange metal, the gravity constructions are a natural tool to make progress on this problem. Possible experimental tests of this conjecture are also outlined.
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              As more strange metals emerge and their physical properties come under the scrutiny of the vast array of experimental probes now at our disposal, their mysteries will be revealed and their commonalities and differences cataloged. In so doing, we should be able to understand the universality of strange metal physics. At the same time, the anomalous nature of their superconducting state will become apparent, offering us hope that a new paradigm of pairing of non-quasiparticles will also be formalized. The correlation between the strength of the linear-in-temperature resistivity in cuprate strange metals and their corresponding superfluid density, as revealed here, certainly hints at a fundamental link between the nature of strange metallicity and superconductivity in the cuprates. And as the gravity-inspired theories mature and overcome the challenge of projecting their powerful mathematical machinery onto the appropriate crystallographic lattice, so too will we hope to build with confidence a complete theory of strange metals as they emerge from the horizon of a black hole.
              
                
                  Curved spacetime with a black hole in its interior and the strange metal arising on the boundary.
                  This picture is based on the string theory gauge-gravity duality conjecture by J. Maldacena, which states that some strongly interacting quantum mechanical systems can be studied by replacing them with classical gravity in a spacetime in one higher dimension. The conjecture was made possible by thinking about some of the fundamental components of string theory, namely D-branes (the horseshoe-shaped object terminating on a flat surface in the interior of the spacetime). A key surprise of this conjecture is that aspects of condensed matter systems in which the electrons interact strongly—such as strange metals—can be studied using gravity.},

              The observation of a reconstructed Fermi surface via quantum oscillations in hole-doped cuprates opened a path towards identifying broken symmetry states in the pseudogap regime. However, such an identification has remained inconclusive due to the multi-frequency quantum oscillation spectra and complications accounting for bilayer effects in most studies. We overcome these impediments with high-resolution measurements on the structurally simpler cuprate HgBa

Therefore, the Fermi surface comprises a single quasi-two-dimensional pocket. Quantitative modelling of these results indicates that a biaxial charge density wave within each CuO
              2
              plane is responsible for the reconstruction and rules out criss-crossed charge stripes between layers as a viable alternative in Hg1201. Lastly, we determine that the characteristic gap between reconstructed pockets is a significant fraction of the pseudogap energy.},

              In cuprate superconductors, the doping of carriers into the parent Mott insulator induces superconductivity and various other phases whose characteristic temperatures are typically plotted versus the doping level
              p
              . In most materials,
              p
              cannot be determined from the chemical composition, but it is derived from the superconducting transition temperature,
              T

The E–k dispersion is kept rigid and the chemical potential moves towards lower or higher energies with increasing or decreasing hole-concentration, respectively, over a wide hole-concentration range from the nearly optimal-doped condition with a transition temperature of 32 K to a heavily over-doped condition where the superconducting transition disappears. By comparing the shape of the FS determined for the present Bi2201 with that reported for the Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ (Bi2212), we found that the area surrounded by the FS in the Bi2201 is fairly larger than that in the Bi2212. Estimated hole-concentration in the Bi2201 was found to vary from 0.25 to 0.43 holes/Cu, that is more than twice as large as that in the optimally doped La2−xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) and Bi2212 superconductors of 0.17 holes/Cu.},

The values of the `bare' parameters are obtained via fits with the first principles LDA-based band structures in LSCO, NCCO and Bi2212. The corresponding `dressed' parameter sets which account for correlation effects beyond the LDA are derived by fitting experimental FS maps and dispersions near the Fermi energy in optimally doped and overdoped systems. The interlayer couplings \$t\_z\$ and \$t\_\{bi\}\$ are found generally to be a substantial fraction of the in-plane hopping \$t\$, although the value of \$t\_z\$ in NCCO is anomalously small, reflecting absence of apical O atoms in the crystal structure. Our results provide some insight into the issues of the determination of doping from experimental FS maps in Bi2212, the role of intercell coupling in c-axis transport, and the possible correlations between the doping dependencies of the binding energies of the Van Hove singularities (VHSs) and various prominent features observed in the angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) and tunneling spectra of the cuprates.},

Then, the high-energy and chain-related degrees of freedom are integrated out and we arrive at two, nearest-neighbor, orthogonal, two-center, I-band Hamiltonians, Hl and H{\textless}, for respectively the even and odd bands of the bi-layer. Of the 8 orbitals, CuXz\_y2,02,. 03,, and Cu, have u character and Cu,, Cu,,, 02,, and 03, have IT character. The roles of the Cu, orbital, which has some Cujzz\_, character, and the four TTorbitals are as follows: Cu, provides 2nd- and 3rd-nearest-neighbor (I’ and r”) intra-plane hopping, as well as hopping between planes (fl). The rr-orbitals are responsible for bifurcation of the saddle-points for dimpled planes. The 4-c-band Hamiltonian is generic for flat CUOZplanes and we use it for analytical studies. The klldependence is expressed as one on II = (cost\%, + cosak,) 12 and one on v = ( cos bk, - cosak,) /2. The latter arises solely through the influence of Cu,. The reduction of the cr-Hamiltonian to 3- and l-band Hamiltonians is explicitly discussed and we point out that, in addition to the hoppings commonly included in many-body calculations, the 3-band Hamiltonian should include hopping between all 2nd-nearest-neighbor oxygens and that the l-band Hamiltonian should include 3rd-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We calculate the single-particle hopping between the planes of a bi-layer and show that it is generically: tl (kll) G 0.25 eV.? (1 - 2ut’/t)-*. The hopping through insulating spacers such as (BaO)Hg(BaO) is an order of magnitude smaller, but seems to have the same klldependence. We show that the inclusion of t’ is crucial for understanding ARPES for the anti-ferromagnetic insulator Sr2CuO2Cl2. Finally, we estimate the value of the inter-plane exchange constant JI for an undoped bi-layer in meanfield theory using different single-particle Hamiltonians, the LDA for YBa\$ZqOc, the eight- and four-band Hamiltonian\% as well as an analytical calculation for the latter.

	abstract = {Within the Composite Operator Method (COM), we report the solution of the Emery model (also known as p-d or three band model), which is relevant for the cuprate high-Tc superconduc- tors. We also discuss the relevance of the often-neglected direct oxygen-oxygen hopping for a more accurate, sometimes unique, description of this class of materials. The benchmark of the solution is performed by comparing our results with the available quantum Monte Carlo ones. Both single- particle and thermodynamic properties of the model are studied in detail. Our solution features a metal-insulator transition at half filling. The resulting metal-insulator phase diagram agrees qual- itatively very well with the one obtained within Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. We discuss the type of transition (Mott-Hubbard (MH) or charge-transfer (CT)) for the microscopic (ab-initio) parameter range relevant for cuprates getting, as expected a CT type. The emerging single-particle scenario clearly suggests a very close relation between the relevant sub-bands of the three- (Emery) and the single- band (Hubbard) models, thus providing an independent and non-perturbative proof of the validity of the mapping between the two models for the model parameters optimal to describe cuprates. Such a result confirms the emergence of the Zhang-Rice scenario, which has been recently questioned. We also report the behavior of the specific heat and of the entropy as functions of the temperature on varying the model parameters as these quantities, more than any other, depend on and, consequently, reveal the most relevant energy scales of the system.},

The phase diagram resembles the generic phase diagram of the cuprates, showing a strong asymmetry with respect to electron and hole doped regimes, in agreement with experiment. Asymmetric features are also seen in one-particle spectral functions and in the charge, spin and d-wave pairing susceptibility functions. We address the possible reduction of the two-band model to a low-energy single-band one, as it was suggested by Zhang and Rice. Comparing the two-band Hubbard model properties with the single-band Hubbard model ones, we have found similar low-energy physics provided that the next-nearest-neighbor hopping term t' has a significant value (\$t'/t {\textbackslash}approx 0.3\$). The parameter t' is the main culprit for the electron-hole asymmetry. However, a significant value of t' cannot be provided in a strict Zhang and Rice picture where the extra holes added into the system bind to the existing Cu holes forming local singlets. We notice that by considering approximate singlet states, such as plaquette ones, reasonable values of t', which capture qualitatively the physics of the two-band model can be obtained. We conclude that a single-band t-t'-U Hubbard model captures the basic physics of the cuprates concerning superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, pseudogap and electron-hole asymmetry, but is not suitable for a quantitative analysis or to describe physical properties involving energy scales larger than about 0.5 eV.},

              The minimal ingredients to explain the essential physics of layered copper-oxide (cuprates) materials remains heavily debated. Effective low-energy single-band models of the copper–oxygen orbitals are widely used because there exists no strong experimental evidence supporting multi-band structures. Here, we report angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy experiments on La-based cuprates that provide direct observation of a two-band structure. This electronic structure, qualitatively consistent with density functional theory, is parametrised by a two-orbital (

Conversely, the elementary excitations on the heavily overdoped side of the phase diagram remain largely unexplored. Important breakthroughs could come from the study of Tl2Ba2CuO6+δ (Tl2201), a structurally simple system whose doping level can be tuned from optimal to extreme overdoping by varying the oxygen content. Using a self-ﬂux method and encapsulation, we have grown single crystals of Tl2201, which were then carefully annealed under controlled oxygen partial pressures. Their high quality and homogeneity are demonstrated by narrow rocking curves and superconducting transition widths. For higher dopings, the crystals are orthorhombic, a lattice distortion stabilized by O interstitials in the TlO layer. These crystals have enabled the ﬁrst successful ARPES study of both normal and superconducting-state electronic structure in Tl2201, allowing a direct comparison with the Fermi surface from magnetoresistance and the gap from thermal conductivity experiments. This establishes Tl2201 as the ﬁrst high-Tc cuprate for which a surfacesensitive single-particle spectroscopy and a comparable bulk transport technique have arrived at quantitative agreement on a major feature such as the normal state Fermi surface. The momentum dependence of the ARPES lineshape reveals, however, an unexpected phenomenology: in contrast to the case of under- and optimally-doped cuprates, quasiparticles are sharp near (π, 0), the antinodal region where the gap is maximum, and broad at (π/2, π/2), the nodal region where the gap vanishes. This reversed quasiparticle anisotropy past optimal doping, and its relevance to scattering, many-body, and quantum-critical phenomena in the high-Tc cuprates, are discussed.},

The observed charge order appears around the \$({\textbackslash}pi/3,0)\$ wavevector and remains robust from cryogenic temperatures to room temperature. To investigate the origin of this charge order in the overdoped region, we use determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations to examine models with various interactions. We demonstrate that this CDW originates from remnant correlations in overdoped cuprates. The doping-independent wavevector \$({\textbackslash}pi/3,0)\$ further reflects the presence of nonlocal electron-phonon couplings. Our study reveals the importance of phonons in the cuprates, which assist correlated electrons in the formation of exotic phases.},

The \$c\$-axis resistivity, in its essential aspects, is discussed in the context of quantum critical point. Finally, I consider a zero temperature problem with one of its spatial dimensions compactified. The warning is that this compatification scale at the quantum critical point behaves similarly to the finite temperature problem, but obviously being at zero temperature there is no dissipation.},

	abstract = {We report on the development of a high-resolution and highly efficient beamline for soft X-ray resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) located at the Taiwan Photon Source. This beamline adopts an optical design that uses an active grating monochromator (AGM) and an active grating spectrometer (AGS) to implement the energy compensation principle of grating dispersion. Active gratings are utilized to diminish defocus, coma and higher-order aberrations, as well as to decrease the slope errors caused by thermal deformation and optical polishing. The AGS is mounted on a rotatable granite platform to enable momentum-resolved RIXS measurements with scattering angles over a wide range. Several high-precision instruments developed in-house for this beamline are described briefly. The best energy resolution obtained from this AGM–AGS beamline was 12.4 meV at 530 eV, achieving a resolving power of 4.2 × 10

            This article gives a summary of inelastic neutron scattering studies searching for signatures of a strong electron–phonon coupling in high temperature superconductors. Special emphasis is laid on the anomalous dispersion, the unusually large linewidths and the anomalous temperature dependence observed for plane polarized copper‐oxygen bond‐stretching vibrations. It will be discussed in how far these results can be understood within conventional density functional theory or require recourse to theories for strongly correlated electrons, in particular the concept of charge stripe order.

The initial consensus was that phonons could not produce transition temperatures near 100 K, and the main direction of research focused on nonphononic mechanisms. Subsequent work last reviewed by L. Pintschovius in 2005 showed that electron-phonon coupling in the cuprates is surprisingly strong for some phonons and its role is controversial. Experiments performed since then identified anomalous behavior of certain Cu–O bond-stretching phonons in cuprates as an important phenomenon that is somehow related to the mechanism of superconductivity.

The inelastic excitation spectra remain essentially unchanged with doping despite crossing a topological transition in the Fermi surface. This indicates that the spectra contain little or no direct coupling to electronic excitations near the Fermi surface, rather they are dominated by the resonant cross-section for phonons and CDW-induced phonon-softening. We interpret our results in terms of a CDW that is generated by strong correlations and a phonon response that is driven by the CDW-induced modification of the lattice.},

            The perovskite oxide SrTiO3 is an n-type semiconductor, which exhibits superconductivity at low temperatures even though there are extraordinarily few electrons. In most materials, with so few electrons it becomes difficult to pair them into a macroscopic superconducting ground state. This regime is also unusual in that most theories of superconductivity rely on electrons that are much faster than their coupling (typically lattice vibrations or phonons). By using techniques in which tunneling junctions are engineered with atomic recision, we are able to probe the electronic structure of this material. The experiments indicate a large discrepancy between the electron–phonon coupling strength and the superconducting properties. This places SrTiO3, a host material for a variety of exotic quantum phases (i.e., in FeSe/SrTiO3, LaAlO3/SrTiO3), in a unique regime of superconductivity.

              The polaron is a quasi-particle formed by a conduction electron (or hole) together with its self-induced polarization in a polar semiconductor or an ionic crystal. Among various polarizable examples of complex oxides, strontium titanate (SrTiO

              surface prepared by vacuum annealing. Systematic analyses of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectra show that these Fröhlich polarons are two-dimensional and only exist with inversion symmetry breaking by two-dimensional oxygen vacancies. Our discovery provides a rare solvable field theoretical model, and suggests the relevance of large (bi)polarons for superconductivity in perovskite oxides, as well as in high-temperature superconductors.},

	abstract = {The charge-density-wave (CDW) instability in the underdoped, pseudogap part of the cuprate phase diagram has been a major recent research focus, yet measurements of dynamic, energy-resolved CDW correlations are still in their infancy. We report a high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study of the underdoped cuprate superconductor HgBa\$\_\{2\}\$CuO\$\_\{4+{\textbackslash}delta\}\$ (\$T\_c = 70\$ K). At \$T=250\$ K, above the CDW order temperature \$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CDW\} {\textbackslash}approx 200\$ K, we observe significant dynamic CDW correlations at about 40 meV. This energy scale is comparable to both the superconducting gap and the previously reported low-energy pseudogap. At \$T = T\_c\$, a strong elastic CDW peak appears, but the dynamic correlations around 40 meV remain virtually unchanged. In addition, we observe a new feature: dynamic correlations at significantly higher energy, with a characteristic scale of about 160 meV. A similar scale was previously identified in other experiments as a high-energy pseudogap. The existence of three distinct features in the charge response is highly unusual for a CDW system, and suggests that charge order in the cuprates is closely related to the pseudogap phenomenon and more complex than previously thought. We further observe the paramagnon dispersion along [1,0], across the two-dimensional CDW wavevector \${\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{q\}\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CDW\}\$, which is consistent with magnetic excitations measured by inelastic neutron scattering. Unlike for some other cuprates, our results point to the absence of a discernible coupling between CDW and magnetic excitations.},

Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to investigate the doping- and temperature-dependent CDW evolution in La2-xBaxCuO4 (x=0.115-0.155). We discovered that the CDW develops in two stages with decreasing temperature. A precursor CDW with quasi-commensurate wavevector emerges first at high-temperature. This doping-independent precursor CDW correlation originates from the CDW phase mode coupled with a phonon and "seeds" the low-temperature CDW with strongly doping dependent wavevector. Our observation reveals the precursor CDW and its phase mode as the building blocks of the highly intertwined electronic ground state in the cuprates.},

Interestingly, the softening occurs below the superconducting (SC) transition temperature T\$\_\{c\}\$, in contrast to the metallic systems, where the softening occurs usually below the CDW onset temperature T\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{CDW\}\}\$. An understanding of the `anomalous' nature of the phonon-softening and its connection to the pseudo-gap phase in under-doped cuprates remain open questions. Within a perturbative approach, we show that a complex interplay among the ubiquitous CDW, SC orders and life-time of quasi-particles associated to thermal fluctuations, can explain the anomalous phonon-softening below T\$\_\{c\}\$. Furthermore, our formalism captures different characteristics of the low temperature phonon-softening depending on material specificity.},

abstract = {There are strong indications that high-temperature superconductivity in the cuprates is formed amid competing orders, but only two have been observed unambiguously. The so-called stripe order has been observed in a Lanthanum-based cuprate family and consists of coexisting charge-and-spin modulations and occurs at a characteristic dopant concentration in which the critical temperature Tc has a dip. Now, Ghiringhelli et al. (p. 821, published online 12 July; see the Perspective by Tranquada) have used resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to uncover a related but apparently two-dimensional charge order in the much cleaner YBCO cuprate family. The charge fluctuations were not commensurate with the lattice and did not originate in the characteristic oxygen chains of YBCO. The order appeared only in a narrow interval of dopant concentrations and competed with superconductivity, which provides a natural explanation for a plateau in Tc observed in the same range. Scattering experiments uncover an order competing with superconductivity in a cuprate family. The concept that superconductivity competes with other orders in cuprate superconductors has become increasingly apparent, but obtaining direct evidence with bulk-sensitive probes is challenging. We have used resonant soft x-ray scattering to identify two-dimensional charge fluctuations with an incommensurate periodicity of ~3.2 lattice units in the copper-oxide planes of the superconductors (Y,Nd)Ba2Cu3O6+x, with hole concentrations of 0.09 to 0.13 per planar Cu ion. The intensity and correlation length of the fluctuation signal increase strongly upon cooling down to the superconducting transition temperature (Tc); further cooling below Tc abruptly reverses the divergence of the charge correlations. In combination with earlier observations of a large gap in the spin excitation spectrum, these data indicate an incipient charge density wave instability that competes with superconductivity.}}

abstract = {Many elemental metals, such as lead and aluminum, become superconducting at low temperatures. Bismuth, a semimetal with very low carrier density, stays nonsuperconducting down to 10 mK. Prakash et al. performed tricky magnetization measurements to show that pure bulk bismuth does undergo the superconducting transition at a tiny temperature of about 0.5 mK (see the Perspective by Behnia). Because bismuth does not fit neatly into the standard picture of superconductivity, further theoretical work is necessary to explain the findings. Science, this issue p. 52; see also p. 26 Superconducting quantum interference device measurements show that bismuth is a superconductor at temperatures below 0.5 millikelvin. At ambient pressure, bulk rhombohedral bismuth is a semimetal that remains in the normal state down to at least 10 millikelvin. Superconductivity in bulk bismuth is thought to be unlikely because of the extremely low carrier density. We observed bulk superconductivity in pure bismuth single crystals below 0.53 millikelvin at ambient pressure, with an estimated critical magnetic field of 5.2 microteslas at 0 kelvin. Superconductivity in bismuth cannot be explained by the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory because its adiabatic approximation does not hold true for bismuth. Future theoretical work will be needed to understand superconductivity in the nonadiabatic limit in systems with low carrier densities and unusual band structures, such as bismuth.}}
